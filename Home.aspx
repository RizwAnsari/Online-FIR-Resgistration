            <h2>F.I.R.</h2>
            <p>
                A first information report (F.I.R.) is a written document prepared by police organizations when they receive information
                about the commission of a cognisable offence.
                It is generally a complaint lodged with the police by the victim of a cognizable offense or by someone on his or her behalf,
                but anyone can make such a report either orally or in writing to the police. Investigating work of the police starts after 
                an FIR is recorded.
            </p>
            <p>
                FIR is an important document because it sets the process of criminal justice in motion. It is only after the FIR is 
                registered in the police station that the police take up investigation of the case. Anyone who knows about the commission 
                of a cognizable offence, including police officers, can file an F.I.R.<hr /><br/>
